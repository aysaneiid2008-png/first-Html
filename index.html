<p>One of Frisch-Auguste Bartholdi's most prominent statements about the character of freedom, which well illustrates her perspective, is this:</p>        
<q>I hate any superfluous detail in sculpture. The forms and works of this art should be broad, massive, and simple.</q>
<p>And he chose a lamp (torch) to be a symbol that was clearly understandable from a distance, without complex details that would be lost in the distance.</p>
